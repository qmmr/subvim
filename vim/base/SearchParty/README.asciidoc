SearchParty
-----------

_Enhanced searches, highlights and matches for Vim_

Visual Searches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +*+  Searches for the next occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindNext+

* +#+  Searches for the prior occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindPrior+

* +&+  Starts a +:substitute+ using the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindSubstitute+

Literal Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<leader>/+ Prompts for a literal string to search for. This does
              NOT use a regular expression, so the characters you type
              here will be searched for literally without any magic
              interpretation. The +<Up>+ key scrolls through prior
              literal search history.
              +<Plug>SearchPartyFindLiteral+

Search Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<C-L>+      Temporarily clears search highlight.
               +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightClear+

* +<C-BSlash>+ Toggles search highlighting.
               +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightToggle+

* +<leader>*+  Highlights all occurrences of +word+ under the cursor.
               +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWord+

* +<leader>g*+ Highlights all occurrences of +WORD+ under the cursor.
               +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWORD+

Pattern Searches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<leader>ms+ Prompts for a pattern and sets the current search to
               that pattern without moving the cursor to the next
               match of that pattern.
               +<Plug>SearchPartySetSearch+

Matches
~~~~~~~

* +<leader>mm+ Prompts for a pattern and uses +matchadd()+ to highlight all
               occurrences of that pattern in the current window.
               +<Plug>SearchPartySetMatch+
+
There are six match patterns available, called +SPM1+-+SPM6+ respectively.
Using more than six matches will recycle through the SPM set, losing
the previous match assigned to that slot.
+
By default, the terminal palette colours #1-#6 are used for +SPM1+-+SPM6+.
You can override these by providing lines like this in your +~/.vimrc+ file:
+
  hi SPM1 ctermbg=123
+
NOTE: Do this after you have set your colorscheme.

The following functions and commands are available for Search Party matches:

* +SearchPartyMatchDelete(number)+ - clear match by number
* +SearchPartyMatchList+ - list all match patterns
* +SearchPartyMatchNumber(number)+ - reset match number (+1-6+)
